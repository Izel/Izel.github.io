*Follow these recommendations and you will avoid the most common mistakes and misunderstandings.*

There is not such a perfect culture or a culture better than others. Remember that the fact you arrive in a country does not mean all their habitants have to change their costumes to make you feel good and welcome. 

Islamic countries are not an exception. However, they have a particular thing that makes us think twice before visiting them: their religion and customs have been vandalized with a  lot of bad propaganda spreaded in Hollywood movies. That bad propaganda is just bad propaganda, most of the time is not like that, the key is understanding the culture before traveling, reading about or asking for information.

After visiting some Islamic countries (some of them more than once) here you have  my 11 recommendations I can bring you according to my experience traveling to Islamic countries.

Be prepared about what they think of western woman
Before I start, I want to clarify that this is something general. Not all the men in the Islamic countries think like this, I'm making a general reference, of course there are exceptions and since the culture has become more global, some of them also understand the basics of western cultures.

In the Islamic countries, in general, they see western women as easy women. Why? Because it is what they see in movies. Most of them think western women just wanna get drunk and have sex and specially if you are travelling alone. Don't be surprised if you are walking on the street and a guy comes to you to offer you transport, tours, touristic information, and.. And.. and.. sex. 

Not only happened to me, but also to other girls I know.  Just look at them with an angry face, don't say anything and continue walking. You can’t change this, but you can handle it.


**1. Read about the country**
Not all the islamic countries are the same. Some of them are more extreme than others. Not in all islamic countries women have to cover totally and walk behind men, it depends on the country. That’s why it is very important to read about the country, watch videos in youtube or ask, maybe the sister of the wife of your friend has a friend who traveled there. Sometimes  Is better to avoid traveling as a woman alone to some islamic countries. Check if it is your case.


**2. Do not wear suggestive clothes**
Apply to ALL Islamic countries but is more severe in ones than others.  Avoid singlets, shorts, dresses that can show much skin. What can you wear? Well, blouses with long or short slaves, skirts and dresses that cover your knees or longer, pants, jeans, leggings. If it is too hot and you wanna wear singlets, put on a thin jacket, t-shirt or pashmina. 

In some islamic countries it is not necessary to cover your head. On the other hand, in others (specially in those located in the middle east) is better if you not only cover your head but also cover your legs totally. 

*Remember: Usually the capital cities have more related measures about this, however is better if you respect the locals*


**3. Avoid having eye contact or physical contact with men**
For Latin culture physical contact is very common. We embrace, kiss and touch very much, usually we say hello and goodbye with a kiss (Latinamerica), two (Spain, Italy, Portugal) or even three (France). Those gestures will be misunderstood by most of the people in slamic countries. Checking hands is enough to say hello and goodbye. Trust me. 

After a week in *Aserbaján*, a couple of female friends and I noticed that men were always flirting with us.  Waiters, the guys in the hotel, the taxi drivers… When we were back in out home country, we realized (after reading some posts and articles in Internet) that eye contact is an open invitation to flirt, is like *“Hey, I am free and open, you can come, let's drink a coffee and … see what happen"* Yes sister, we were the filter girls in town!. 

**4. Be gentle but avoid excess**
Thank you, it was very nice of you, it was very kind of you, it was delicious… saying those things is Ok, however, and this is strictly connected with the fouth recommendation, avoid exces.  

Usually, I am extra kind with people working in general services: waiters, waitresses, cleaning… their job is hard and not well paid to additionally support the arrogance of customers. However, I have found that smiling too much, talking too much, asking too much for recommendations is misunderstood mostly.

**5. If they say they pay, let them pay**
Something that is very very beautiful of islamic culture in general is that they are very generous with food (Thanks Ala!). If they offer to pay the bill, let them pay. If you insist on paying the bill or at least pay it partially, most of them will take it wrong, they will feel offended because you are indirectly saying they are not able to pay the bill. Trust me, if they offer to pay, let them pay and say “thank you, that was very kind from you” or “Thanks for your generosity”.


**6. Drinking alcohol moderately or avoid it**
It depends on the country. In the most relaxed countries you can find alcohol in stores, bars or restaurants but you are just allowed to drink in the place or bring it home.

As a general recommendation, if you are allowed to drink, and you wanna drink, drink! BUT be moderated. Islamic culture judges alcohol consumption very hard and bad things can happen. Avoid getting drunk or even dizzy even if you are not alone, even if you are with your best friend and  especially if you are with people you just know some days ago.


**7. Respect the code when you visit the Mosques**
There is a strict code to enter mosques. Remove your shoes at the entrance, cover your head with a pashmina, wear a long-sleeved blouse and a long skirt. In general terms, You can't show your arms, legs and head.  Remember these places are congregation temples, they have their doors open but you must respect the praying time and leave or wait outside until they finish.
If you wanna visit the beautiful Mosques and see their magic interior design, bring the adequate clothes and arrive in the appropriate schedule.


**8. Avoid laughing too loud**
In some Islamic countries it is not a good idea. Some people, especially men, will look at you badly.


**9. Enjoy the food**
Most of them have amazing Gastronomy. Turkey, Giorgia, Armenia, Azerbaiján, India… Enjoy!


**10. Avoid talking about religion**
Is a very controversial topic in any culture, but specially for Islam. The Islam religion has good and beautiful things, but also some horrible and degradant practices that has bring to the extreme in some countries if you see it from western perspective. If they insist on talking about it, is ok, sometimes people just wanna show you the good things from their culture according to their point of view, just listen and try to understand their point of view.

**11. Wear comfortable shoes.**
Islamic countries in general terms have a very rich history, a lot of ruins, temples and magical places to visit. Pack your sneakers and flats!


Go, visit that Islamic country you wanna discover.Keep in mind my recommendations, have a nice time, collect adventures, experiences and pictures. If something bad or funny happens to you, share it in a comment and we can enrich this post to save and empower other sisters.
